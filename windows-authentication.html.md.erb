This topic describes how to integrate Windows Diego Cells with an existing Active Directory domain in order to enable support for apps using Windows Authentication.

## <a id='overview'></a> Overview

Windows Authentication allows users accessing a Windows app on <%= vars.windows_runtime_abbr %> to transparently authenticate using their domain credentials.

## <a id='prerequisites'></a> Prerequisites

Before you configure the <%= vars.windows_runtime_abbr %> tile for Windows Authentication, ensure that you meet the requirements:

* Your Active Directory instance is configured with a GMSA and a regular user that has been granted access to the GMSA credentials (see the [Microsoft docs](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/virtualization/windowscontainers/manage-containers/manage-serviceaccounts) for specifics).
* Your Windows Diego cells have the appropriate [firewall rules](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/virtualization/windowscontainers/manage-containers/gmsa-troubleshooting#check-the-firewall-configuration) to access the Active Directory instance.
* [Application Security Groups](../concepts/asg.html) must be configured to allow traffic from app containers to the Active Directory instance.
* [TCP Routing](../operating/configure-pas.html#networking) must be enabled and configured.
<p class="note warning"><strong>Warning:</strong> Using Windows Authentication via the gorouter is strongly discouraged and will result in authentication sessions for one user being returned to a different user.  Apps using Windows Authentication should <strong>only</strong> be accessed via TCP routes.</p>
* The **The Gorouter and apps use mutual TLS to verify each otherâ€™s identity** under [Advanced Features](installing.html#config-advanced-features) must not be selected, as this disables TCP routing.
* Depending on your IaaS, you may need to configure BOSH DNS handlers so that your app containers can resolve domain resources via the Active Directory instance. See the <a class="external-link" href="https://docs.pivotal.io/ops-manager/install"><strong>Ops Manager Documentation</strong></a> for IaaS-specific instructions.
* Apps pushed intending to use Windows Authentication must use the HWC buildpack

<p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> We strongly recommend using an isolation segment for Windows Authentication, as all apps in the <%= vars.windows_runtime_abbr %> installation will have access to the GMSA credentials.  To associate a <%= vars.windows_runtime_abbr %> tile with an isolation segment, so that its Diego Cells run in that segment, see <a href="./isolation.html">Windows Diego Cells in Isolation Segments</a>.</p>


## <a id='limitations'></a> Limitations

* Authenticating via the cf cli with Windows Authentication is not supported
* Every app in the in the <%= vars.windows_runtime_abbr %> installation will have access to the GMSA credentials.  There is no way to configure it on an app-by-app-basis
* Windows Authentication delegation from App to Service is not supported

## <a id='configure-tile'></a> Configure the tile

First follow the steps in the [Microsoft docs](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/virtualization/windowscontainers/manage-containers/manage-serviceaccounts#create-a-credential-spec) to create the appropriate values, then select **Windows Authentication** and follow this procedure:

1. Under **Windows Authentication**  select **Enable**.
1. For the **Fully-qualified Active Directory domain name** field, enter the domain name of the Active Directory instance to integrate with.
1. For the **Standard user name** field, enter a user which has been granted access to retrieve the GMSA password.
1. For the **Standard user password** field, enter the password for that user.
1. For the **Container credential spec** field, enter the JSON credential spec generated from the [Microsoft docs](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/virtualization/windowscontainers/manage-containers/manage-serviceaccounts#create-a-credential-spec).

1. Click **Save**.
1. [Deploy the tile](installing.html#deploy)

## <a id='rotating'></a> Rotating the standard user

For this, follow along with the steps in the [Microsoft docs](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/virtualization/windowscontainers/manage-containers/manage-serviceaccounts#use-case-for-creating-gmsa-account-for-non-domain-joined-container-hosts) but do not create a new service account or security group

1. Create a new user account.
1. Add the user to the security group that guards access to the GMSA service account.
1. Update the **Standard user name** and **Standard user password** fields with the new user information.
1. Click **Save**.
1. [Deploy the tile](installing.html#deploy)
